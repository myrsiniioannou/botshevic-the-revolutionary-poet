If there are fewer stars now
than when I was a child,
I canâ€™t say
which are missing,
who was the last to see them.
Is it not a crime
unless we call it a crime?
It is difficult to document
a disappearance,
a boat full of stars
capsized.
Stars lying in the sand
face-down,
wearing small shoes.
Add that to the report:
some of the stars washed up
in small shoes.
