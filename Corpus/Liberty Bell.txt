Ring on, ring on sweet Liberty Bell
For peace on earth, good will to men.
A story true, ye kindly tell,
From Bunker Hill down to Argonne.
Ring on, ring on sweet Liberty Bell
In every clime where freedom dwells
Your sweetest strains and imparting knells
On New Year's eve was heard again.
Ring on, ring on sweet Liberty Bell
Peal after peal, your music swell
Beneath the blue the white and red
That waves so proudly today o'er the living
And so sacredly o'er the dead.
