Around the congress with closed door
Thousands of anxious people pour
To wait till all suspense be o'er.
And still above the bellman waits
The slow decision of the fates,
While fears depress and hope elates.
"Passed, it has passed," at length they cry,
Ten thousand glad mouths make reply,
And send the echoes to the sky.
"Ring! ring!" exclaims the watching boy;
The bell responds with notes of joy.
Freedom's proclaim its sweet employ.
Loud and more loud the proud notes swell,
The people's shouts responding well,
All o'er the land the glad news tell.
From sea to sea, from pole to pole,
The echoes of that bell shall roll,
Till freedom comes to every soul.
